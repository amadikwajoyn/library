The euphoria was deafening; it was a moment of victory for the common man whose joy is not altogether in the fact you won at the polls but that you will do something new for him.\r\nSimon was one of such men who came out en masse to be part of what he considered the â€˜reawakening of hopeâ€™ for him and his family. He had not forgotten that morning when his wife reminded him of his son who was sent home from school because he had not paid his school fees, and his daughter who had asthma and who could not go for treatment for want of fund. He remembered how she stood before him and cried out â€œYou have to do something, or we would all be dead in days!â€\r\n', 1, 'publish'),

He also knew that the rightness would involve the creation of more jobs so that he can get a chance to take care of his daughter and pay his sonâ€™s school fees and the availability of better hospitals that can treat his daughterâ€™s asthma.\r\nSo as Simon watched you take the Oath of Office, he didnâ€™t know when the smile formed around his lips. He was smiling because he remembered how you promised to solve of his problems. He was smiling because he believed you would keep to your words.\r\nDear President, you have come on board at a crucial time in Nigeriaâ€™s history and this has passed a very important message to not just Nigerians but to the entire world. Indeed the historic import of your victory has transformed dull flickers of hope into a raging fire of optimism for better times within the Nigerian people. Everyone expects that at the end of the day, you will go down, a legend. They expect absolutely nothing less!\r\n', 3, 'publish'),

Income inequality in Nigeria is at an all-time high, life expectancy is on the decline, while infant mortality and maternal mortality rates are on the rise. Corruption, tribalism and religious strives are plaguing the country. The masses continue to be oppressed by some sections of the privileged class including the political and economic classes. Nigeria has become a fake construction project and the sweat, toil and earnings of the masses at the bottom of the pyramid have been used to improve the fortunes of a privileged class at the top of the pyramid.</p>\r\n<p>Sir, the average Nigerian has become tired of being tired, frustrated of being frustrated and sick of being sick. A strong minority is oppressing a weak majority in today&rsquo;s Nigeria. Also many Nigerians have met their untimely deaths on the nooses of inadequate health facilities, poor roads and terrorism. Nigerians are experiencing class segregation whereby the less privileged are denied access to justice, quality education and healthcare.</p>\r\n<p>Dear Sir, we need a combination of vision and practicality, to end the oppression, injustice and classism currently taking place in Nigeria. Many people have asked why Nigeria is underdeveloped; why she has continued to remain stagnated and backward; why our leaders have continued to do the same thing over the years which is to starve the majority and reduce them to hungry mongrels. The simple answer is that <strong>none of our leaders have dared or cared to ask the question &ldquo;why not?&rdquo; </strong>One leader goes up to the seat of power and perpetrates his corrupt acts, and when he leaves, another leader will climb up and continue the wastage that the former had initiated. Sometimes, we hear them asking &ldquo;<strong>what can we do, the corruption has become inbred and has eaten deep&rdquo;. </strong></p>\r\n<p>The truth however, is that we cannot experience any kind of growth and development until we can ask the question <strong>&ldquo;why not?&rdquo; </strong>We must challenge the existence of the rot and putrefaction that is now overwhelming us.</p>\r\n<p>Dear Sir, we need Governors in Nigeria who will not dress as women to escape the wrath of the people they have wronged. We need Inspectors-General of police who will not cart away millions of our naira in the guise of carrying out their duty. We need Ministers who will not subject young hapless job seekers to the dehumanizing point of having to crowd them in one place where they would trample themselves to death in the name of recruitment exams. We need Speakers of the House of Representatives who will not pass laws to enrich only their pockets at the detriment of several other Nigerians. We need Local Government Chairmen who will not leave their Local Government Areas to settle in big cities where they would enjoy comfort with the aid of stolen wealth, thereby forgetting the very people they have primarily been asked to cater for. We need Commissioners who are not mere stooges and appendages of their Governors but who by the strength of their true worth have been appointed. We need Presidents who are daredevils and who are not too slow, silent or timid to steer the ship of this devastated nation to sunlight and poise.</p>\r\n<p>We need leaders; men of worth! We need leaders; men who will stand against the current of evil tidings and who will alter the status quo for the greater good of the land. We need men who are filled with a compassionate longing for putting others first because they are fully aware that leaders are actually servants and not domineering Lords. We need outspoken men with a sharp intolerance to corruption and malfunctioning realities; who will map out definite and sure paths to making us a better people and our fatherland a better place to live in.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Sir, have you considered Martin Luther King Jr.? He was such a leader! He knew what the popular notion was; he knew that injustice and disregard for human rights were firmly in place and he also knew that it was unheard of to speak against the reigning norm, yet he chose to stand up and out, he chose to die than remain silent because to him, being silent in the face of evil was death by itself. And while he stood the chance of making extraordinary wealth from the thousands who had become his supporters, he chose to commit himself totally to his cause and he did pursue it till he breathed his very last breath. Leaders of like passion we need who, towing the line and pulling us along, will, with zest and fervour, unveil the glory for which we have oftentimes longed.</p>\r\n<p>Dear Sir, Nigeria has never lacked leaders with great and lofty ideas. Our history shows that men, who have ruled Nigeria at various points in time, all had phenomenal ideas for transforming the nation. Obasanjo had his NEEDS initiative, Yar&rsquo;Adua introduced his 7-Point Agenda and now Jonathan is dangling his Transformation Agenda before our faces. A deep look into the contents of these initiatives and ideas for growth and advancement would reveal that the brains behind them were not idle because these ideas all had and still have a contagious magic and an overwhelming potential for totally turning this nation around from the eclipse where it is headed to the happy revival that we all seek. A look for instance, into the Transformation Agenda of Dr Goodluck Ebele Jonathan would reveal an inherent ability to initiate change, strike development and clothe this badly battered and threadbare entity called Nigeria, from shame and ridicule. The question then is:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;Why do we have such great ideas, such great initiatives, such bold plans and such powerfully assertive goals and yet remain below the standard rung of the international ladder of development?&rdquo; </em></p>\r\n<p>Sir, we want to plainly state that the answer, without a further mincing of words, is the absolute lack of drive, the abysmal absence of action and the disheartening indifference of the initiators to the outcome of their goals. They only succeed at bringing goals into existence and then they stop there. They succeed in exciting the hopes and expectations of Nigerians, then they close the curtains not minding how cruel that may be. They are only master entertainers who try to ignite our interests and then leave us alone when our blood is hot.</p>\r\n<p>We need a different kind of leader in Nigeria, who will rise up with his path firmly mapped out; who will push forward with great ecstasy and absolute determination, thereby swiftly pushing past oppositions to achieve greatness for Nigeria. We need a leader who will have but one clear goal not many blurry ones. A man who knows what his obstacles are and stand up to face them. We need a daredevil leader who will walk out to meet the foes who battle his dream, without fear and without flinching.</p>\r\n<p>We need leaders in Nigeria who will dare to be different; who will not merely adopt the status quo but who will look at the future and envisage what it should look like and then, with the people in mind, plan definite steps in attaining that future. We need leaders who will not be part of an existing trend but who will set their own trends in motion.</p>\r\n<p>Sir, you must understand that it is your solemn duty to change an unfortunately unfavourable trend and not relapse in it. Corruption is the reigning trend in our dear country. This situation of gross decay has been made worse by the nonchalant attitudes of our leaders to it. Anyone who climbs upon the seat of power suddenly becomes a part and parcel of corruption. But you must be a leader who will go up there and set that &lsquo;change&rsquo; in motion.</p>\r\n<p>We need a leader who will not just see his position as an avenue for making self-enriching moves but an avenue for turning around the tide of the endless impoverishment of the citizenry by the ruling class.</p>\r\n<p>It is that kind of leader that will forever remain indelible in the hearts of every Nigerian for countless generations to come.</p>\r\n<p>We need a leader who will make us become, once again, the nation whose vast ethnic diversities speak of a glorious unification in multiplicities; whose tranquil natural landscapes tell a tale of peace and great prosperity; whose national colours are not a mere piece of artwork but a testimony of our productivity and blossoming greenery; a people who have poise; a proud people made proud by the organization and perfect coordination of their lives and living patterns; a people living fat and content in the land of their fathers; a rich and happy people. This is the dream of our founding fathers and this is the desire of Nigerian now!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Any man who can bridge this gap between our founding dream and our thirst in the 21<sup>st</sup> century; that man is the hero, who will go down a legend forever!</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Will you be that man, Sir?</strong></p>\r\n</body>\\r\\n</html>', 0, 'publish'),

Year in, year out, new issues are arising that help to further complicate day-to-day living for the average Nigerian child. Perhaps one of the most devastating news to come out of Nigeria in early 2015 was the report of a 10 year old girl-child strapped with explosives and made to blow up herself and other people in a market in Maiduguri. This terrible act of using children as suicide bombers is a new dimension in the catalogue of abuse and exploitation that children in Nigeria experience on a daily basis.\r\nYet, in almost all of the manifestos of the key political parties that contested the recent general elections in March 2015, very little mention was made of the welfare of the child and what concrete steps would be taken to make Nigeria a better place for children. Nigeria remains one of the few countries in the world with a near absence of structures and effective systems to ensure the safeguarding and protection of children. Nearly all institutions that deal with children in loco parentis â€“ schools, hospitals, the criminal justice system â€“ all have little or no structures at all for ensuring the safety and protection of children who come to their attention and care.\r\nYet in other countries around the world, the notion of child safeguarding is a key agenda pursued and implemented in the best interests of children. By this I do not mean countries in the West alone.\r\nMany African countries are making strong efforts to domesticate and fully implement the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child by creating local laws and regulations, effective structures and systems to ensure they are able to meet their obligations towards children. Nigeria too has made some efforts in enacting a Child Rights Act in 2003. Some of the states have domesticated the law locally. However, unfortunately only 26 out of 36 states in Nigeria have passed this law. For those who have passed the law, there is minimal evidence on the ground of any strong efforts at implementation.\r\nSo what impact does this have on children in Nigeria? According to the UN, Nigeria is one of the worst places on earth to be a child. There are more children out of education than in any other country in the world and I have written about this very deplorable situation on this forum in the past. Nigerian children, more than other children in Africa are at risk of human trafficking and exploitation. We are of course still reeling from the shock of the abduction of over 200 school children in Chibok, Borno State. Other children have been abducted by terrorists in this area. Terrorism poses a special threat to Nigerian children â€“ they are indeed the worse victims. They are orphaned, made homeless and displaced. They are sexually abused and exploited, with many falling pregnant as a result. They are unable to attend school and are left psychologically traumatised by the effects of the violence and devastation they have experienced and see happening around them. They are victims in other ways too. So many children have been attacked and killed in their own school dormitories by the terrorists. The mantra: â€œwestern education is a sinâ€ means schools are targeted by Boko Haram â€“ leaving many children injured, harmed and killed.\r\nOf course there are many other indices that show the Nigerian child in dire strait. Education standards are falling and very poor yearly examination results are a key indicator of this. Many children cannot attend school because their parents cannot afford to send them hence they are engaged in street trading and other forms of hazardous labour â€“ which can also lead to them being abused in other ways. The health care system is obsolete in many parts of the country â€“ meaning children needing medical care might not have access to it. Early marriage continues to be a problem in some parts of the country. Girls who should be at school learning and playing like other children are being sexually and emotionally abused as â€œwivesâ€. Harmful cultural practices like branding children as witches are a problem â€“ exposing children to unwarranted abuse and harm. Child poverty is a major challenge in the country and while the incoming government of Muhammadu Buhari has promised free school meals to all children in primary schools across the country, it is not clear if this electoral promise can be fulfilled with the dwindling income accruing to the federal government from the sale of oil. With his government due to take over power in a couple of days, one would hope that buhariâ€™s government will give some priority to the issue of children. If this does not happen, and the government chooses the path of past regimes, then it would indeed be a missed opportunity to move forward and be on a par with the rest of the world, where children are concerned. \r\nNigeria does not need to hold tokenistic events every year to celebrate its children. Rather more concrete efforts should be put in place to ensure their welfare, protect their innocence and secure their future. Only then do we merit the right to celebrate each and every Nigerian child, be proud of who they are and encourage them to be prepared to contribute their quota to the betterment of their country.\r\nThis article is an edited version of the one published by The Sheet online newspaper on 19 January 2015 titled: â€œCry The Dear Childrenâ€.\r\nDebbie Ariyo OBE is Chief Executive of AFRUCA UK (www.afruca.org) a charity promoting the rights and welfare of children, and a postgraduate student in public administration at the London School of Economics and Political Science.  \r\n\r\n', 3, 'publish'),

At that point the party could not provide satisfactory answers to the question of the presence of reactionary elements like Femi Fani-Kayode within its fold. Perhaps, the party leadership thought they could be reformed and reconstructed into the partyâ€™s ideological dispositions only to be proven wrong before long. This was why I wrote in my article, â€œAPC CRISES: TURNING TABLES?â€ that apart from the unifying ambition of defeating former President Goodluck Jonathan, it appears the party has no further ambition. \r\nEven though my views, like many Nigerians at that time, were in tandem with the APC, I have never been confortable with persons like Fani-Kayode in the party. To me his presence can only guarantee monumental embarrassment (which I think he represents) to the party. I told my friend Kitan Omole, who like me, was a Buhari sympathiser but unlike me he admired Fani-Kayode for his attack on Jonathan in the early days of the party that the man is only on holiday in the party and should be taken seriously. My friend will not agree with me because as he was carried away by his (Fani-Kayode) criticisms of President Jonathan on social and print media and was enjoying his undeserved popularity. On this FFK, as he is known among his admirers, is a very smart guy who knew what he was doing!\r\nEverything worked for him in the APC. He used that platform to rain personal abuses on president Jonathan(not sparing the Igbos who support him). His diatribes against the Igbos in no small ways contributed to the branding of the APC as an â€œanti-Igboâ€ party. Surprisingly, many pro-Jonathanâ€™s Igbo writers who earlier criticised FFK and APC, saw wrong in his views anymore when he started â€œrevealing APC secretsâ€ later on. All was well to these ones as long as you supported Jonathan even if you had earlier insulted their mother. Like I said, FFK is a smart man, or a con man if you like, who knew well what he was doing.  All these he did till he had a strange dream-the APC fielding a â€œMuslim-Muslimâ€ ticket for the 2015 presidential election!\r\nI am not aware till this day, which position the APC gave FFK for him to be privy to such information. I am equally not aware that the APC that I know like my palms, will ever take FFK so seriously knowing fully his antecedents, will ever give his any serious position in that party. When FFK slept and had such a strange dream remains a mystery to me till today. Well, not only did APC field a respected staunch Pentecostal Christian Pastor , Professor Yemi Osinbajo as its Vice Presidential candidate( as against FFKâ€™s strange dreams), but also won the March 28 presidential election. \r\nThis leads me to my main point-FFK is the baby that will not grow. Babies cry for everything especially for food. You can easily know when baby FFK wants to eat. He cries the loudest when he is hungry. He dances at his best when his belly is full. He does not know how to call it quit when it comes to eating. This was why former President Obasanjo beautifully describes him as a dog that will bark at his bossâ€™ enemies (real or imagined) and shake his tail or sing your praises when he is given food. It hurts, but very true!\r\nOnly recently did FFK made into the news again. He has largely been quiet since the presidential election. He has been busy going from one Court to another for trial over his money laundering charges. As though in victory mood (from his money laundering case), he launched attacks (as he usually does when he feels like eating) on the Buhari administration for its inability to tackle the challenge of Boko Haram. He restated his traditional argument that Buhari was in fact a â€œsilent sympathiserâ€ and financier of the deadly group. It takes no less a person than FFK to manufacture such Made-in-Ife revelations!\r\nI will say this for the records. FFK told the world as at the time he re-joined (?) the Peopleâ€™s Democratic Party(PDP), that it was General Buhari, one of his several lies he told about the General, that is the prime sponsor of the dreaded group. He opined that the North was using it to frustrate the Jonathan administration when he wrongly said it was the General that said he would make Nigeria ungovernable for former President Jonathan. Fact does not matter to FFK, (just like it didnâ€™t matter to his role model, Joseph Goebbels, Adolf Hitlerâ€™s Minister for Propaganda) as long as the lie sounds good and big enough. \r\nOne would have expected that this baby will grow from breast sucking to at least chewing solids. If Buhari, taking FFKâ€™s infantile logic, was the one behind Boko Haram to frustrate Jonathan, except FFK stays in the Mars, he would have known that the terror activities continuing under Buhari clears him of his previous allegations of the General.\r\nMy unsolicited advice to President Muhammadu Buhari is to be aware of this hungry baby now that he is idle with no food in sight. This is his natural way of seeking employment and the President be on guard against considering his uninviting resume. This is exactly what his recent attacks on the Buhari administration is intended to achieve. This was on record to have led several opportunistic attacks on former President Olusegun Obasanjo before he was invited to join the latterâ€™s administration as Special Assistant to the President on Public Affairs and later as Minister for Aviation. This tool was the deployed to get former President Jonathanâ€™s attention before he was appointed Presidential campaign spokesman for the 2015 election. He can at best be ignored; those who have learnt to do so he largely left alone. President Buhari should consider taking Obasanjoâ€™s advice but taking him as a dog which barks and when it tires out, it maintains its peace!\r\nPerhaps, FFK did not properly understand the lyrics in the old school matching song which goes thus:\r\n                                      â€œWherever you go;\r\n                                        Wherever you be;\r\n                                       Do not say â€œyesâ€;\r\n                                       When you mean to say â€œnoâ€.\r\nIn parenthesis, please donâ€™t add â€œBaba Ibadanâ€, which is usually the most exciting part of song. Can we still recall that the same FFK when on air even before the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) could commence collating the election result, â€œINEC Chairmanâ€ FFK announced that his party, PDP, was leading in 23 states of the federation? Need I say more that he says â€œyesâ€ when he means â€œnoâ€? \r\nIf he tells you itâ€™s raining, it is imperative that you go outside to check the weather yourself. Like Squealer in George Orwellâ€™s Animal Farm, if he calls something white, itâ€™s time to check well to see if itâ€™s not black. This exactly is why no responsible person should take him seriously because is known to say yes, when he means no!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 1, 'publish'),

No nation can ever attain great heights without committed and patriotic citizens. The survival of this nation is dependent on our level of commitment to national issues.   \r\nWhat is commitment?\r\nCommitment according to Shiv Khera is sticking to one thing in spite of choices.  It is keeping your sight focused on development despite all attacks and challenges confronting us.\r\nCan you imagine what kind of a world it would be if people did not keep their commitments? Imagine what lack of commitment between husband and wife will cause, lack of commitment between an employer and an employee.\r\nIt is the spirit of commitment that makes a mother gets up in the middle of the night to breastfeed her crying baby. It is the spirit of commitment that makes a student decline exam malpractices and rather study hard. It is commitment that endears military personnel go to war, risking their lives. It is that same spirit that engulfed all the patriots that fought for our (Nigeria) independence. It is that same spirit that possessed the 56 men who signed their names to a document on the 4th of July, 1776, which they well knew would bring freedom to all Americans or leave every one of them (the 56 men) hanging from gallows.\r\nCommitment is that spirit, that virtue that propels us to go an extra mile to give our best in whatever we do. To be committed means not quitting or losing hope at the advent of challenges. \r\nNothing worthwhile as ever been created without commitment.\r\nWhat is Patriotism?\r\nThere are several definitions for patriotism but Mark Twainâ€™s will be most suitable for this context: It states â€œPatriotism is supporting your country all the time and your government when it deserves itâ€.\r\nOne of the major challenges confronting our dear nation is the fact that there are people who are party loyalists than people who are loyal to the nation. We have people who are supporters of the government of the day than people who are supporters of the long term ideologies and values that will sustain this nation.\r\n\r\nThe government in power today and the ones we will have in the future, all have time limit, but the Nation remains forever. Therefore, supporting a particular government or party is not wise; we should rather support the values and ideas that will sustain this nation, the values of hard work, sacrifice, honesty and excellence.\r\nIt is a pity that most of us (the led) who are not actively participating in politics, who are also victims of bad governance, instead of being loyal to the nation are loyal to political parties. Parties we do not understand how they are being managed. We sometimes even fight for parties and government of the day in the name of patriotism. It is time we stopped being fooled by some seat occupants and switch on the spirit of patriotism. \r\nPatriotism can mean supporting the government of the day only to the extent at which they are committed to people oriented policies, probity and delivery. It can mean voting for the right candidate (s) during elections and not voting in favour of political parties, ethnicity and religion. \r\nPatriotism is the willingness to sacrifice for a better tomorrow.  To be a patriotic citizen can also mean living as if there is no other nation on earth except the Federal Republic of Nigeria.\r\nIt can also mean living up to the true meaning of the words we all say while reciting the National pledge:\r\nâ€œI pledge to Nigeria my country, to be faithful, loyal and honest. To serve Nigeria with all my strength, to defend her unity and uphold her honour and glory, so help me Godâ€.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 2, 'publish'),

The return to Democracy in 1999 with the coming to power of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo, however offered another opportunity to map a way out of this conundrum. Realizing the massive investment that would be needed to turn around the fortunes of the power sector, the Chief Obasanjo Administration initiated the privatization process with the aim to bring in the private investors with the required technical and financial muscles to make the process a success. Prior to the privatization, bulk of the funds, through loans and grants, for the electric power sector had come from International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) with the remaining from the Federal Government.\r\nAnother point worthy of note is that with the way the monolithic structure like NEPA was managed, there was no way the organization could be profitable, and therefore even lend a hand in the upgrades of its own infrastructure.\r\nThe privatization and unbundling of the monolithic and inefficient NEPA was therefore a necessary and proactive step to open up the Electric Power Sector Ecosystem to more players, and the necessary investment. This also led to the signing into law, in 2005, the Electric Power Sector Reform Act. The Privatization is believed to be agreed to by Nigerians by this single act. This definitely cannot go down well with everybody.\r\nIn recent time, following the victory of the All Progressives Congress at the polls, there has been calls from so many quarters, some even powerful people who should know better, but for pecuniary reasons, for the whole privatization process to be scrapped.\r\nAgree with me or not, one bane of Nigeriaâ€™s development is the expectation for an immediate gratification. There is a process to everything. There is no miracle anywhere.  The privatization is a process. It must take its due course. \r\nYes, you can fault the process of bidding or selection of companies, but not the privatization itself.\r\nThe former Vice President, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, while calling for the reversal of the privatization, recalled that the Obasanjo-led administration which sunk several billions of United State Dollars into the sector, took the wrong approach in tackling the power sector but failed to address the problem of the power sector because the government took a long-term measure rather than a short-term approach.\r\nThere is absolutely nothing wrong with taking a long term approach, what is wrong is definitely not taking into consideration the proper implementation along the way.\r\nWhile there is nothing wrong with the new government taking a review of the privatization process, we should be talking about solutions that will take us forward. There are definite issues that have been thrown up by the privatized power sector, and these are what we should be looking for solutions for.\r\nThere are challenges in the Generation, Transmission, and Distribution of power. There are grey areas in the Electric Power Sector Reform Act, there are issues with Metering, and there are issues with Electric Power Consumer Rights, especially in response to complaints. There is most definite issue with finding funding, or liquidity of the privatized companies, we should look into this. We should be talking about recapitalization of these companies.\r\nBureau of Public Enterprise (BPE) should invite other companies that initially bid for the different Successor Companies to come back, and see how they can pull together their resources into making the power sector work.\r\nWe should encourage these privatized companies to open their books, and look at the capital market for investors. I am not too impressed with Ikeja Electric, who had hard times paying the $131million to acquire the company itself, saying they got Meters for $106million.\r\nMost of the distribution companies are not liquid. They have to wait for payment from monthly bills to come in before they could run their operations. This is not a good omen.\r\nThe economic cost of reversing the Power Privatization is more than the cost of making the system works. \r\nThe fate of the electric power sector is in our hands. The fate of Nigeria is in our hands. We must do the right thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n', 2, 'publish'),

Following concerns from various quarters about the perceived saturated nature of the e-commerce sector of the Nigeria economy and in view of the ongoing profit boom in the sector, the Managing Director of Supermart.ng, Raphael Afaedor has said that the market is not yet saturated and that there is need for more entrants. \r\nAfaedor who expressed this concern recently said that what is more important is that each of the businesses should carve a niche for themselves. Citing the cases of Supermart.ng which focuses on delivering groceries to households within three hours across Lagos and other brands focusing air travel or hospitality, Afaedor emphasized the need for more e-commerce websites to come into the market and focus on a particular need.\r\nAccording to him â€œI donâ€™t believe the market is saturated already, there are still more needs to be met. For instance, supermart.ng came and saw the stress that people go through on daily basis from one market to another in order to purchase their groceries, we decided to assemble all the products into one market place where people can order for everything at the exact market price and have it delivered to their door step in three hours. New brands need to also identify other needs and develop solutions for them. The market is very largeâ€\r\nAfaedor further stated that contrary to the notion that more use of technology in business will render people jobless, the reverse is the case as e-commerce has actually created more jobs for people. In explaining this, he stated that â€œin a typical e-commerce business, there are many stages involved. There are people in merchandising who go out to access and take the pictures of the products, there are those in logistics who ensure that the products are safely delivered and there are people in the customer service who handle possible complaints that may come up following the transactionâ€.\r\nHe however advised that with regards to profitability, each entrepreneur will have to decide the model that best appeals to him. â€œSome may choose to start with expansion in order to make more profit in the future while others may focus on profit within the shortest time and then plan expansion later, the entrepreneur will have to make that choiceâ€.\r\n', 1, 'publish');
